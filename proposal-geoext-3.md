# Towards GeoExt 3 - Supporting both OpenLayers 3 and ExtJS 6

GeoExt (http://geoext.github.io/geoext2/) is Open Source and enables 
building desktop-like GIS applications through the web. It is a JavaScript
framework that combines the GIS functionality of OpenLayers with the user
interface savvy, rich data-package and architectural concepts of the 
ExtJS library provided by Sencha.

Version 2.1 of GeoExt (currently in beta-status) is the successor to the 
GeoExt 1.x-series, brought support for ExtJS 5 and is built atop the following
installments of its base libraries: OpenLayers 2.13.1 and ExtJS 5.1.0 
(or ExtJS 4.2.1 at your choice).

The next version of GeoExt (v3.0.0?) will support OpenLayers 3 and the new and
shiny ExtJS 6 (not released at the time of this writing). The talk will focus
on the following aspects:

* Introduction into GeoExt
* New features in OpenLayers 3 and ExtJS 6 and how the y can be used in GeoExt
* The road towards GeoExt 3 
* Results of the planned Code Sprint in June
  (see https://github.com/geoext/geoext3/wiki/GeoExt-3-Codesprint)
* Remaining tasks and outlook

The new features of OpenLayers (e.g. WebGL-support, rotated views, 
smaller build sizes, etc.) and Ext JS 6 (Unified code base for mobile and 
desktop while providing all functionality of ExtJS 5) and the description of 
the current state of this next major release will be highlighted.
